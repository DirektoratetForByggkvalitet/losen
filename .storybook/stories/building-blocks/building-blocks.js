      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>type</code>: The only property that is shared across <strong>all</strong> nodes in the
          schema. The type is required in order to determine what type of node it is.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>id</code>: Needed in order to map texts passed as the value for the translation prop
          to the Wizard component.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>summary</code>: Optional part of every block and is a set with the details attribute.
          If you want a expand collapse element that can provide more information use these two
          properties.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>details</code>: Accepts html code. Se comment for <code>summary</code>.

          Also, the <code>hide</code> and <code>show</code> properties is available for all input and
          output types, as well as Select/Checkbox/Radio options. The properties are logical
          expressions used to determine if the item in question should be shown or not.

      <P>
        Sometimes, the need for presenting complex information in the form of a matrix arise. The{' '}
        <em>Table</em> features a way of visualizing multiple dimensions with dynamic state that
        reacts to user wizard input through a dynamic structure and flexible tests to mark cells as
        active/inactive.

      <H4>Properties</H4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>cells</code>: A two-dimensional array of rows/cols. The cols are table cells with
          properties for a cell. The structure looks like this ðŸ‘‡. <strong>Required</strong>
          <pre>{`[
  [

      // Possible types: Heading (th) and Cell (td) - REQUIRED

      // How many rows this cell spans
      rowspan: 2,

      <H3>Summary</H3>
      <P>A summary of all input and errors in the wizard</P>

      <H3>Information</H3>
      <P>
        Kinda like a text block but it has a nice icon before the text and it is dispalyed on the
        result page.
      </P>

      <H3>Signature</H3>
      <P>A nice signature line for documents that should be signed.</P>

      <H3>Error</H3>
      <P>A textblock that looks like a error message</P>
      <H4>Properties</H4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>warning</code>: Mark the text block as a warning and will display it on the result
          page. Default: false
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
