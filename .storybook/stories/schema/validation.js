        Since the schema has a lot of properties and quite a few things can go awry. To make it
        a little easier to find out if the schema is OK, the wizard framework provides a CLI
        tool that can be used to validate the schema. The
         <a href="https://github.com/netliferesearch/losen/tree/master/example">example wizard</a>
         contains an npm script (<code>validate</code>) that validates the schema that comes with
        the example. Perform <code>npm run validate</code> to check the schema.
      </p>

      <H2>Validator CLI</H2>
      <p>
        In order to use the validator directly, call the bin file installed in
        <code>node_modules/.bin</code> in your project like this when standing in the project root:
      </p>

      <pre>{`$ ./node_modules/.bin/losen validate ./path/to/schema.js
ðŸŒˆ  The schema is ok
`}
      </pre>

      or in case something is wrong with your schema, it'll look more like this ðŸ‘‡

      <pre>{`./node_modules/.bin/losen validate ./src/api/cat.json
ðŸš’  There seems to be something wrong with your schema ðŸ‘‡

schema.3.children.0:
Group is missing the text property`}</pre>
    </div>
  );
}
