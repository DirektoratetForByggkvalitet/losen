[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/netliferesearch/dibk-wizard-framework.svg?token=FNwbLhwtPg2ioyJfu4Yu&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/netliferesearch/dibk-wizard-framework)

The wizard framework contains the logic and building blocks necessary to building wizards large and small.

We use [Storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook) to document the components. The Storybook is hosted on Firebase at [dibk-storybook](https://dibk-storybook.firebaseapp.com/).

## Building a wizard
See the storybook documentation for an introduction to how to build a wizard with the framework.

## Tests
Tests are written with jest, and can be run with `npm run test`.
