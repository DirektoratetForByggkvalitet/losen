# Logical expressions

The wizard framework use a Domain Specific Language, a DSL for short, to express logical
expressions in the schema. The expressions is parsed and translated to functions that can
be run on the user data.

This gives a rich language for describing dependencies in data, validation rules and
preriqusites that must be met in order for something to show, hide etc.

The expressions consist of a few types that is used for composing other expressions:

`or` and `and`. These can be used to combine simple (and complex) expressions in order to express more complex expressions. An example:

## Examples Below is a few examples to show how the expressions are constructed.

### Two simple expressions

`person.age` is greater than or equal to 20 **and** `person.sex` is required to have a value.

```json
{
  "type": "and",
  "clauses": [
    { "field": "person.age", "operator": "gte", "value": 20 },
    { "field": "person.sex", "operator": "required" }
  ]
}
```

### Nested complex expression

(`person.age` is greater than or equal to 25 **and** `person.sex` is required to have a value) **or** `person.age` is less than 20.

```json
{
  "type": "or",
  "clauses": [
    {
      "type": "and",
      "clauses": [
        { "field": "person.age", "operator": "gte", "value": 25 },
        { "field": "person.sex", "operator": "required" }
      ]
    },
    { "field": "person.age", "operator": "lt", "value": 20 }
  ]
}
```
