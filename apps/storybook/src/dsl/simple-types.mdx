# Simple types in the DSL

The simple types is the comparisons, existence checks and negations that
give power to the expression. Each of the types is described in detail
below.

## Field reference as expression value

The comparisons can reference fields for the value to compare agains by
using a "field reference". The field reference is an object with a field
property, like this:

### Example of comparing against a scalar value

```json
{
  "field": "some.field",
  "operator": "gt",
  "value": 4
}
```

### Example of comparing agains another field

```json
{
  "field": "some.field",
  "operator": "gt",
  "value": {
    "field": "some.other.field"
  }
}
```

## The expression types

### gt

Expression describing a greater than comparison.

```json
{ "field": "some.field", "operartor": "gt", "value": 3 }
```

### lt

Expression describing a less than comparison.

```json
{ "field": "some.field", "operartor": "lt", "value": 3 }
```

### gte

Expression describing a greater than or equal comparison.

```json
{ "field": "some.field", "operartor": "gte", "value": 3 }
```

### lte

Expression describing a less than or equal comparison.

```json
{ "field": "some.field", "operartor": "lte", "value": 3 }
```

### eq

Expression describing a equality check.

```json
{ "field": "some.field", "operartor": "eq", "value": "apekatt" }
```

### neq

Expression describing a not equal comparison.

```json
{ "field": "some.field", "operartor": "neq", "value": true }
```

### between

Expression describing a range check, the value being between two values.

```json
{"{ field: 'some.field', operartor: 'between', value: [3, 6] }"}
```

### required

Expression describing a required value, meaning that the field exists.

```json
{ "field": "some.field", "operartor": "required" }
```

### not

Expression describing a check for a property that must have a falsy
value.

```json
{ "field": "some.field", "operartor": "not" }
```

### is

Expression describing a check for a property that must have a truthy value.

```json
{ "field": "some.field", "operartor": "is" }
```
