# DComplex types in the DSL

In order to be able to compose expressions in a meaningful way, the DSL features two
complex expression types: <code>and</code> and <code>or</code>.

## and

Logical and. All clauses must yield a truthy value.

```json
{
  "type": "and",
  "clauses": [
    { "field": "myField", "operator": "gt", "value": { "field": "yourField" } },
    { "field": "myField", "operator": "ls", "value": 1000 }
  ]
}
```

## or

Logical or. At least one of the clauses must yield a truthy value.

```json
{
  "type": "or",
  "clauses": [
    { "field": "myField", "operator": "eq", "value": "ðŸ¦„ " },
    { "field": "myField", "operator": "eq", "value": "ðŸŒˆ " }
  ]
}
```
