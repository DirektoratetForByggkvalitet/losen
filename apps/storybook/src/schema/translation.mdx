# Schema translation

A common use case when building services such as wizards for a wide audience is the need for showing content in more
than one language.

In <em>losen</em> this is handled by allowing you to pass a translations object to the <code>Wizard</code> node
when rendering the wizard. Multiple languages are supported, and a language selector is shown in the bottom of the
table of contents if multiple languages are set up. Translations are passed to losen by adding the

<code>translations</code> to the <code>{`<Wizard>`}</code> component.

Losen expects translations provided to be in the following structure:

```json
{
  // the property name (en) should be the same as the
  // key property inside the object
  "en": {
    "key": "en"
    "name": "English",
    "meta": {
      "title": "Title of the wizard"
    },
    "tags": {
      //...
    }
  }
}
```

The <code>tags</code> property for each translation is an object where the
properties are references to the <code>id</code> nodes in the schema. Given
that we have for instance an Input node in our schema with the <code>id</code>
property set to <code>fornavn</code>, the complete translation object for an
English translation would look like this ðŸ‘‡

```ts
const trans = {
  en: {
    key: "en"
    name: "English",
    meta: {
      title: "Title of the wizard"
    },
    tags: {
      fornavn: {
        heading: "First name"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

With the translation above, the field will get the heading "First name" if
the user selects the English translation.

## Properties for translation items

Below is an example showing a translation object with all the available properties for an item in the translations
object.

```json
{
  "fornavn": {
    "heading": "First name",
    "description": "The name you've got that is <strong>not</strong> your family name.",
    "image": {
      "large": "https://url.to/large/image.png",
      "small": "https://url.to/small/image.png"
    }
  }
}
```

## Finding the schema node IDs

When working with the content in the wizard, append `?debug` to the page url to show the
id of all the nodes in the wizard. The nodes ids will show as pink labels in the top-right
corner of the component.

## Overriding content (a "hack")

In some cases you might want simply to override the headings, text or images in the schema.
If you want non-technical editors to be able to override part of the content in the wizard
you can add a Norwegian translation with the key <code>no</code> to the wizard.

The Norwegian translation is the default one, and the language picker won't show unless you
add some other language than that.
