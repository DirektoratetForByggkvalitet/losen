# Computed properties

When building complex wizards we often end up with a complex logical
structure and lots of repeated logical tests. Getting the logic right
once is a hard job, and keeping track of and updating duplicates of the
same logic in your schema is both tedious and error prone.

Losen features _computed props_ as a solution to this. In essence
computed props is a way of declaring a logical expression (with the DSL)
and being able to refer to the current result of that expression from
anywhere in your schema just as if it was a value in the state.

## Declaring a computed prop

A computed prop is declared by putting a key in the `computed` part
of your schema, like this:

```json
{
  "meta": {
    //...
  },
  "computed": {
    "oldEnough": {
      "field": "age",
      "operator": "gte",
      "value": 21
    }
  },
  "schema": {
    //...
  }
}
```

## Computing the property

You don't need to compute it yourself. It will be updated whenever data
is updated in the wizard. This happens when the `SET_DATA` redux
action is reduces, but is not something you need to pay attention to. As
long as you build your wizard using the provided logic, it will
happen automagically.

## Referring to the computed properties

When referring to the computed properties, prefix the computed property
name with `$computed.` So if you have a computed prop called `oldEnough` you refer to it using `$computed.oldEnough`. Like this:

```json
{
  "type": "Branch",
  "branches": [
    {
      "test": { "operator": "is", "field": "$computed.oldEnough" },
      "children": [
        //...
      ]
    }
    //...
  ]
}
```
