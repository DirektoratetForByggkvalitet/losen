# Schema validation

Since the schema has a lot of properties and quite a few things can go awry. To make it
a little easier to find out if the schema is OK, the wizard framework provides a CLI
tool that can be used to validate the schema. The [example wizard](https://github.com/netliferesearch/losen/tree/master/example)
contains an npm script (<code>validate</code>) that validates the schema that comes
with the example. Perform <code>npm run validate</code> to check the schema.

## Validator CLI

In order to use the validator directly, call the bin file installed in

<code>node_modules/.bin</code> in your project like this when standing in the project
root:

```sh
$ ./node_modules/.bin/losen validate ./path/to/schema.js

ðŸŒˆ The schema is ok
```

or in case something is wrong with your schema, it'll look more like this ðŸ‘‡

```sh
./node_modules/.bin/losen validate ./src/api/cat.json

ðŸš’ There seems to be something wrong with your schema ðŸ‘‡

schema.3.children.0:
Group is missing the text property
```
