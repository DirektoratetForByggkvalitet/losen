# Branch

In order to build a wizard you often need to be able to branch based on
user input. The `Branch` node gives you this posibility, as
described briefly in _Getting started_ section, where the schema
is shown in an example.

## Properties

<Table>
    {common.thead}
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><code>type</code></td>
            <td>
              The type is required in order to determine what type of node it is. For
              a branch node, this property must be set to `Branch`.
            </td>
            <td>Yes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>branches</code></td>
            <td>
              An array of objects containing a test, and list of nodes to show if the
              test passes. Should follow this structure:

              ```ts
              [
                  {
                      test: {
                          field: 'continue',
                          operator: 'eq',
                          value: true
                      },
                      children: [ /* nodes to show */ ]
                  },
                  // ...
              ]
              ```
            </td>
            <td>Yes</td>
        </tr>
        {common.show}
        {common.hide}
    </tbody>

</Table>

## Key concepts

- The tests decide which branch will be shown
- The first branch test that returns a truthy value will be used
- One or no branches will be selected

## Branching anatomy

A _Branch_ node is not represented in the user interface, and the
user will never have to deal with the branching itself. It's an
implementation detail in the algorithm. As a consequence of this, the
branch has no text, heading or any other properties than
`branches`.

## Example

```json
{
  "type": "Branch",
  "branches": [
    {
      "test": { "field": "continue", "operator": "eq", "value": true },
      "children": [
        // ...nodes for when the user continues
      ]
    },
    {
      "test": { "field": "continue", "operator": "neq", "value": true },
      "children": [
        // ...nodes for when the user choose not to continue
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## The test

The test is described in a structured format that allows for describing
most logical expressions and that features a way of referencing data
from fields in the schema. This will be referred to as the `DSL` - short for Domain Specific Language.

The DSL is described in greater detail in a separate section of the
documentation.
