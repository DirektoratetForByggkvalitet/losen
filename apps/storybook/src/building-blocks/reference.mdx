# References

When you need to show something, for instance an Error or a Result page, in more
than one place you want to use the `Reference` instead of manually
duplicating the node in your schema. It will be duplicated for you, and it makes
it a lot easier to manage your schema over time.

A <em>Reference</em> node is not represented in the user interface, and the
reference is invisible both to losen and the end user - as long as the referenced
node exists in the schema, it's just as if you duplicated the node in your schema.
It looks like this:

## Properties

<Table>
  {common.thead}
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>type</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        The type is required in order to determine what type of node it is. For
        a reference node, this property must be set to `Reference`.
      </td>
      <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>nodeId</code>
      </td>
      <td>The id of the node we're referencing.</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
    {common.show}
    {common.hide}
  </tbody>
</Table>

## Example

```json
{
  // ...,
  "schema": [
    {
      "type": "Page",
      "id": "start"
      "children": [
        { "type": "Reference", "nodeId": "coolError" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "Page",
      "id": "otherPage",
      "children": [
        {
          "id": "coolError",
          "type": "Error",
          "warning": true,
          "children": [
            {
              "id": "coolError.text",
              "type": "Text",
              "text": "😎😎😎"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Gotchas

Beware of referencing something inside itself. It will create an infinite loop,
and there will be 🐉🐲🔥.
