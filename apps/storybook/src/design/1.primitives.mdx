# Primitives

The losen wizard design is implemented trough _primitives_. These are HTML elements styled by using [styled components](https://styled-components.com/) and inherit from the styles theme variables. Changing colors in the styles file will update the primitives accordingly.

## Inheritans

The `Wizard` primitive is the base wrapper that applies base styling inherited troughout the wizard. But each primitive is often very specific on it's own font sizes and such.

When losen is used inside another design system the global CSS styling may interfer with the components in the wizard it self.

## Example primitives

All primitives can be found specified as stories in Storybook. Look under _Primitives_ in the left side menu. Some primitives are gathered here as examples.
