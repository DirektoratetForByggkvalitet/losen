# Theming
Losen is based on DiBK's design system, but it is quite easy to change it to accomodate other design systems.

## Overriding styles
You find all used theme variables in the file `losen/styles.ts`. Here you have color variables, font families, border radius, padding, easing, sizes and typograhpy. It is possible to theme losen closer to your design system just by altering these variables. 

The default theme variables can be overridden by the `styles` prop in `Wizard` like so:

```tsx
import { Wizard } from 'losen'
import schema from './schema'
import customTheme from './customTheme.tsx'

<Wizard wizard={schema} styles={customTheme} />
```

## Default styles
Use the default styles file as baseline when overriding. All variables need to be present in the custom theme file.
